# Attribute reference

Everything wf-xano does is driven by HTML attributes — no code required. This page follows the
element/setting split used by [Finsweet Attributes](https://finsweet.com/attributes): **Elements**
define *what a node is*, **Settings** tune *how it behaves*.

## Elements

Structural roles use one key=value attribute: **`wf-xano-element="<name>"`** (like Finsweet's
`fs-list-element`). Key=value is the canonical form because Webflow's Designer strips custom
attributes that have no value. The legacy valueless markers (`wf-xano-list`, `wf-xano-template`, …)
remain supported as aliases.

### List

| Attribute | Required | Applies to | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `wf-xano-element="wrapper"` | ✅ | the outer wrapper | Marks the list root/scope (Finsweet's `wrapper`). Settings live here; everything else is found inside it (or linked by an [instance key](#scoping--instance-keys)). |
| `wf-xano-element="list"` | — | the items container | Optional (Finsweet's `list`): where rendered cards are appended. Defaults to the template's own parent. *(v0.3.0 markup that put `element="list"` + `wf-xano-source` on the root still initializes as a root — deprecated alias.)* |
| `wf-xano-element="template"` | ✅ | the card | The item template. Cloned once per item; the original stays hidden. Rendered clones get `wf-xano-item` and `data-wf-xano-id="<item.id>"`. |
| `wf-xano-element="empty"` | — | any element | Shown when the response has 0 items. |
| `wf-xano-element="loader"` | — | any element | Shown while a request is in flight. |
| `wf-xano-element="error"` | — | any element | Shown when a request fails. |

### Card bindings

These work on any descendant of the template **and on the template root itself**.

| Attribute | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wf-xano-bind` | field name | Sets the element's text (or `value` for inputs/selects/textareas). Supports dot paths for joined records: `brand.company_name`. |
| `wf-xano-fallback` | field name(s) | On a `wf-xano-bind` element: when the bound field is missing (`null`/`""`), bind the first non-missing field from this comma-separated list instead. For date formats only, Xano's unset epoch `0` is also skipped. E.g. `wf-xano-bind="last_edited_at" wf-xano-fallback="published_at,created_at"` → shows the edit date, or the publish date, or the created date. |
| `wf-xano-default` | literal text | Rendered when the value is still missing after `wf-xano-fallback` fields. Real `0`/`"0"` values render directly and beat fallbacks/defaults. A default is a real display value, so `wf-xano-prefix`/`wf-xano-suffix` still wrap it (v0.16.5+; zero semantics corrected in v0.17.0). |
| `wf-xano-src` | field name(s) | Sets an `<img>`'s `src`. Supports a pipe-separated fallback chain and uses the first non-blank field, e.g. `profile_photo\|profile-photo-xano\|profile-photo`. When a value is bound, any stale `srcset` from Webflow responsive images or a placeholder provider is removed so the browser uses the authoritative Xano image. If every field is blank, the template's placeholder `src`/`srcset` remains unchanged. |
| `wf-xano-if` | expression | Shows/hides the element per item: `status === 'Active'`, `budget >= 100`, `applied` (truthy). Operators: `===` `!==` `>` `>=` `<` `<=`. **Logical combos:** `\|` = OR, `&` = AND (`\|\|`/`&&` also fine), e.g. `last_edited_at \| created_at` (show if either present) or `status === 'Active' & applied === false`. AND binds tighter than OR. |
| `wf-xano-link` | field name | Builds the `href` from the field value. Works when the card root is the `<a>` itself. Unsafe protocols such as `javascript:` and `data:` are rejected. |
| `wf-xano-element="show-more"` | — | A clickable that expands a CSS-clamped text element by removing its clamp class (v0.13.0+). Works both inside list cards **and standalone on any page** — static CMS / detail pages, or content bound by another script such as opportunities-3.0.js (v0.14.0+). `wf-xano-target="<field>"` names the field to expand, matched against **both `wf-xano-bind` and `data-opp-bind`**; if it doesn't resolve (or is omitted) the target falls back to the nearest element carrying the `wf-xano-class` clamp class, then any bound element. `wf-xano-class="<class>"` is the clamp utility class removed while expanded and restored on collapse (e.g. `text-style-5lines`); on standalone pages the clamp class is what identifies the target. It accepts **multiple classes and `*` globs** (space-separated) — e.g. `text-style-*line*` strips every matching clamp on the target, so an element with both a desktop and a `-mob` clamp (`text-style-5lines text-style-2lines-mob`) fully expands on both breakpoints (v0.15.0+). Optional `wf-xano-expanded-text="Show less"` swaps the label while expanded — on composite buttons (label + icon children) mark the label child with `wf-xano-element="show-more-text"` so the swap writes there and icons survive (v0.13.1+). Mark icon children with `wf-xano-element="show-more-icon"` to have `is-wf-xano-expanded` toggled on them too — style the rotated state as a combo class on the icon itself (v0.13.2+). While expanded, `is-wf-xano-expanded` is set on the control and the target. Controls whose target isn't actually clamped (short text) are hidden automatically. Clicks don't bubble, so the control is safe inside `wf-xano-link` card anchors. Call `WfXano.initShowMore(scope?)` to re-wire after async content binding. |

### Counts

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `wf-xano-element="total"` | Total item count from the server. |
| `wf-xano-element="count-from"` / `="count-to"` | Visible range — "Showing **9**–**12** of 45". |

### Favorites

Favorites are authenticated, member-scoped controls that work inside cards rendered by either
wf-xano or wf-algolia. Configure `WfXanoConfig.favoritesSource` once, then use:

```html
<button
  type="button"
  wf-xano-element="favorite"
  wf-xano-favorite-type="starter"
  wf-xano-favorite-label-add="Save Starter"
  wf-xano-favorite-label-remove="Remove saved Starter">
  <span wf-xano-element="favorite-visual">Save</span>
</button>
```

| Attribute | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wf-xano-element="favorite"` | ✅ | Marks the save/remove control. The legacy `wf-xano-favorite` marker is also accepted. |
| `wf-xano-favorite-type` | ✅ | Server allow-listed namespace such as `starter`. May live on the control or an ancestor. |
| `wf-xano-favorite-id` | — | Explicit item ID. Otherwise resolves from the closest `data-wf-xano-id`, then wf-algolia's `data-wf-algolia-hit-objectid`. |
| `wf-xano-favorite-label-add` | — | Accessible label while unsaved. Defaults to `Save item`. |
| `wf-xano-favorite-label-remove` | — | Accessible label while saved. Defaults to `Remove saved item`. |
| `wf-xano-favorite-class` | — | Active class applied to the control and marked visuals. Accepts multiple space-separated classes. Defaults to `is-active`. |
| `wf-xano-element="favorite-visual"` | — | Marks a descendant that receives the favorite control's active class. Multiple descendants are supported; unmarked descendants are unchanged. |

When saved, the control and every marked `favorite-visual` descendant get `is-active` by default.
Set `wf-xano-favorite-class="custom-active"` on the control to override that visual class. The
control also keeps the stable internal `is-wf-xano-favorited` class for compatibility. It gets
`is-wf-xano-loading`, `aria-pressed`, and `aria-busy` as before.
Toggles are optimistic and roll back on failure; every visible copy of the same type/ID stays in
sync. An authenticated IDs request hydrates state after reload and whenever another renderer adds
cards. A wrapper with `wf-xano-refresh-on="favorite"` automatically refreshes after a successful
toggle; optionally put the same `wf-xano-favorite-type` on the wrapper to scope refreshes.

Required endpoints under the configured base are `POST <base>/ids` with `{ item_type }` returning
`{ ids: [...] }`, and `POST <base>/toggle` with `{ item_type, item_id }` returning
`{ favorited: boolean }`. Both receive the normal Xano bearer token. Authorization, member identity,
item validation, and the type allow-list must be enforced server-side.

### Pagination

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `wf-xano-element="page-prev"` / `="page-next"` | Prev/next controls. Get `is-disabled` at the range edges. |
| `wf-xano-element="page-number"` | Template button, cloned per visible page. Clones get `wf-xano-page-num`; the current page gets `is-active` and `aria-current="page"`. |
| `wf-xano-element="page-dots"` | Optional ellipsis template, cloned into gaps between the boundary pages and the current-page window (e.g. `1 2 … 7 8 9 … 24 25`). Clones get `wf-xano-page-dot`. Omit it and gaps are simply skipped (no ellipsis). |

Numbered buttons follow Finsweet's boundary + window model: `wf-xano-page-boundary` pages are pinned at each edge and a `wf-xano-page-window` of pages centers on the current page. **Numbered pagination requires the endpoint to return `itemsTotal`** (or `pageTotal`) so the true last page is known — otherwise wf-xano only knows there's a *next* page and shows `current … next`. If your endpoint emits only `nextPage` (Xano's default paged list), use a **load mode** below instead.

### Load modes

Set on the wrapper via `wf-xano-load` (Finsweet's `load` setting). Append modes only need `nextPage`, so they work when the endpoint returns no total count.

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `pagination` *(default)* | Numbered page buttons (needs a true total; see above). |
| `more` | `wf-xano-element="load-more"` appends the next page on click; the control hides when exhausted. |
| `infinite` | Appends the next page as `load-more` (or an internal tail sentinel) scrolls into view. `wf-xano-threshold` (px) tunes the trigger distance. |
| `all` | Fetches every page up front and accumulates. |

Append modes reset (replace, back to page 1) on any filter/search/sort/clear change. The root gets `is-wf-xano-exhausted` when no more pages remain.

### Filters, search, sort

| Attribute | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wf-xano-filter` | field name | **Form controls** (input/select): value becomes request param `field`, re-fetching on `change`. **Checkboxes** sharing a field form a group: checked values combine into a comma-separated param. **Radios** send the checked one's value. **Any other element** (tab, button, link…) becomes a click filter: clicking sends its `wf-xano-value` (empty value = the "All" option, clears the param). |
| `wf-xano-value` | filter value | The real value for checkboxes/radios (Webflow submits `on`) and for click filters. **`*` is the match-all sentinel** for "All" options — it clears the field (use it because Webflow's Designer cannot author an empty attribute value); the control shows as active/checked when no value is set. |
| `wf-xano-toggle` | `true` | On a click filter: clicking the active option again clears it (facet-style toggle). Default is tab semantics (re-click is a no-op). |
| `wf-xano-search` | field name | Text input, debounced → param `field`. |
| `wf-xano-sort` | param name (optional) | Select whose value becomes the sort param. Defaults to `sort`; give the attribute a value to rename it (`wf-xano-sort="sort_by"`). |

Active filter state is reflected with an **`is-active`** class — on the click-filter element
itself, and on the closest `<label>` of checked checkbox/radio filters (styleable in Webflow).
Controls are hydrated from the URL on load when [URL sync](#settings) is on.

### Clear & filter tags (Finsweet grammar)

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `wf-xano-element="clear"` | Click clears **all** user filters (static `wf-xano-param-*` values are kept). Add `wf-xano-filter="field"` to clear only that field. |
| `wf-xano-element="tag"` | Template for active-filter chips — cloned once per user-set filter **value** (comma groups render one chip per value). The original stays hidden. |
| `wf-xano-element="tag-field"` / `="tag-value"` | Elements inside the tag showing the field name / the value. |
| `wf-xano-element="tag-remove"` | Click removes that value from its filter group (falls back to the whole tag element if absent). |

## Settings

Add these to the elements above to tune behavior.

### On the wrapper (`wf-xano-element="wrapper"`)

| Attribute | Values | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `wf-xano-source` | `group:path` or full URL | — (required) | Xano endpoint. `opp30:brand/opportunities/list` → `{xanoBase}/api:opp30/brand/opportunities/list`. |
| `wf-xano-instance` | any key | — | Instance key. See [scoping](#scoping--instance-keys). |
| `wf-xano-method` | `POST`, `GET`, `PATCH`… | `POST` | HTTP method. `GET` sends params as a query string. |
| `wf-xano-auth` | `memberstack`, `none` | `memberstack` | `memberstack` trades the Memberstack JWT for a Xano auth token (cached; reset when the member changes). `none` for public endpoints. |
| `wf-xano-per-page` | number | `20` | Page size, sent as `per_page`. |
| `wf-xano-page-window` | number | `5` | Numbered page buttons centered on the current page. |
| `wf-xano-page-boundary` | number | `1` | Pages always shown pinned at each edge (with `page-dots`, gaps become ellipses). |
| `wf-xano-debounce` | ms | `300` | Debounce for search inputs (can be overridden per input). |
| `wf-xano-url-sync` | `true` | — | Write page + declared filter/search/sort state to the query string (`<key>_page`, `<key>_<param>`) and restore it on load. Static `wf-xano-param-*` values are never serialized or overwritten from the URL. |
| `wf-xano-param-<name>` | any value | — | Static request param, e.g. `wf-xano-param-status="Active"`. |
| `wf-xano-refresh-on` | `favorite` | — | Re-fetch this list after a successful favorite toggle. Add `wf-xano-favorite-type` to scope it to one type. |

### On cards / controls

| Attribute | Applies to | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wf-xano-format` | `wf-xano-bind` elements | Date/time styles: `date` (visitor-locale short, `5/21/2026`), **`date-medium`** / **`date-long`** (`May 21, 2026` — full/short month, pinned en-US so it's stable & unambiguous, v0.10.0+), `datetime`, `datetime-long`. Unset timestamps (Xano `0`) render blank, not `1/1/1970`. Also `short-name` (v0.7.1+) — abbreviates every word after the first (`John Paul Dionisio` → `John P. D.`). Set `WfXanoConfig.locale` to override the en-US default for the named date styles. |
| `wf-xano-display` | `wf-xano-if` elements and the `empty`/`loader`/`error` state elements | Display value when shown (e.g. `flex`). Default clears the inline style so the element's own class takes over. |
| `wf-xano-link-prefix` / `wf-xano-link-suffix` | `wf-xano-link` elements | Wrap the field value: `prefix + value + suffix`. |
| `wf-xano-value` | checkbox/radio filters | The real filter value — Webflow checkboxes all submit `"on"`. |
| `wf-xano-debounce` | a `wf-xano-search` input | Per-input debounce override. |

### State classes

The list root receives CSS classes you can style in Webflow:

| Class | When |
| --- | --- |
| `is-wf-xano-loading` | a request is in flight |
| `is-wf-xano-error` | the last request failed |
| `is-wf-xano-empty` | the last response had 0 items |
| `is-wf-xano-favorited` | a favorite control's item is saved |

## Scoping & instance keys

By default, all elements (bindings, counts, controls) are found **inside the list root**, so
multiple lists on one page never clash.

To place counts, filters, search, sort, or pagination **outside** the list wrapper, give the list an
instance key and tag the outside element with the same key:

```html
<span wf-xano-element="total" wf-xano-instance="opps"></span>

<div wf-xano-element="wrapper" wf-xano-instance="opps" wf-xano-source="opp30:brand/opportunities/list">
  …
</div>
```

The key is also the [URL-sync](#settings) prefix and the argument to `WfXano.get(key)`.

## Requests

- Every request is sent with `cache: 'no-store'` — Xano is authoritative and results are never
  served stale.
- Requests are **sequenced**: when loads overlap (debounced search + a filter click), a stale
  out-of-order response is dropped instead of rendering over the newest one; superseded fetches
  are aborted when supported.
- `POST` (default) sends `{...params, page, per_page}` as a JSON body — matching Xano's standard
  paged list inputs. Responses are normalized from Xano's `{items, itemsTotal, curPage, pageTotal}`
  shape (raw arrays and single objects also work).
- `GET` sends no JSON content-type header, avoiding an unnecessary CORS preflight for public lists.
- Failed append requests keep already-rendered pages and retry the same page on the next attempt.
